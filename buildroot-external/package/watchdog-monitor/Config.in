	  Vitals Monitor Hardware Watchdog Service.

	  Manages the STM32MP1 IWDG hardware watchdog timer.
	  Monitors health of all vitals-monitor services via
	  nanomsg heartbeat IPC. If any critical service fails
	  to report within its deadline, the watchdog is allowed
	  to expire, triggering a system reset.

	  Runs at the highest priority as the last line of
	  defense for system reliability.
